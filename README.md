# Org Visualiser

## __1. Description__
A tool to visualise the AWS OU and account structure for a given org.

## __2. Motivation__
If you have many accounts and OUs it might be hard to have a picture of it in your head. This tools helps build a visualisation

## __3. Example__
Here is how a visualisation could look. This is, of course, a very simple set up with 2 OUs and 4 accounts, but for orgs that have hundreds or thousands of accounts, this would help get a bird's eye view of how their accounts are structured.

## __4. How to use it__

1. You will need Python 3.8.9+ for this tool. If you do not have it installed, please install it from here:
https://www.python.org/

2. Install the dependencies with the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. You can run the script org_visualise.py on an EC2 with an instance role, or on your own machine with the credentials exported using the usual AWS env variables (as below) or with a profile configured using `aws configure` CLI command

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=abc
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=def
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=ghi
```

These credentials are needed as the code will invoke AWS APIs to read accounts/OU details.

You can also provide an IAM role that the above provided profile can assume. To run this script, you can use a role with the AWS managed policy AWSOrganizationsReadOnlyAccess (arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSOrganizationsReadOnlyAccess)

If you want the least privileged policy to run this, here is what the profile would need:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "OrgvisMinimumPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "organizations:ListRoots",
                "organizations:DescribeOrganizationalUnit",
                "organizations:DescribeOrganization",
                "organizations:DescribeAccount",
                "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
                "organizations:ListChildren"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

This script can be run only on the management account, or on a child account that is a [delegated administrator for the AWS account management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/using-orgs-delegated-admin.html).

4. Once this is set up, you can run the script as below (make sure the packages mentioned in requirements.txt are installed)

```
python3 org_visualise.py
```

The html output will be written to output.html by default.

Here are the different command line options that allow you to:
- generate the visualisation only for the OUs, or to include the accounts
- generate the visualisation in dark mode
- choose a different filename

```
python3 org_visualise.py -h
usage: org_visualise.py [-h] [-d depth] [-o output_file_name] [--dark-mode] [--aws-profile aws_profile_name] [--aws-assume-role aws_assume_role_name] [--show-options] [--log-level log_level]

Generate AWS Account/Org structure visualizations

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d depth, --depth depth
                        Indicate if the depth should be only upto the "ou" or all the way to the "account" level. Default is "account"
  -o output_file_name, --output output_file_name
                        Name of the html file to which the output will be written to. Please include the suffix ".html" in the filename. Default is output.html
  --dark-mode           Use this option if you want the visualization with a black background. Default is False
  --aws-profile aws_profile_name
                        Use this option if you want to pass in an AWS profile already congigured for the CLI
  --aws-assume-role aws_assume_role_name
                        Use this option if you want the aws profile to assume a role before querying Org related information
  --show-options        Use this option if you want the graph visualisation options on the visualisation html. This will allow you to try out many different possibilities (for example, showing the graph as a hierarchy). Default is
                        False
  --log-level log_level
                        Log level. Needs to be one of the following: 'DEBUG','INFO','WARNING','ERROR','CRITICAL'```
```

## __5. Design__
The execution flow is as below:
  1. Create a boto3 session (with the profile name provided. If no profile name is provided pass in an empty profile name)
  2. If an IAM role is passed in as a parameter, then assume that role by calling `sts.assume_role` and create a new boto3 session with the assume_role
  3. Create a boto3 `organizations` client.
  4. Get the root id using the API call `organizations.list_roots`
  5. Add the root to the list of nodes
  6. Call `organizations.list_children` to get all the accounts under the current OU/root and add them to the list of nodes with the parent as the current root/OU.
  7. Call `organizations.list_children` to get all OUs under the current OU/root and add them to the list  with the parent as the current root/OU.
  8. Recursively do the steps 6,7 until there are no OUs left. This will ensure that all OUs and Children are called.
  9. At this time all OUs and Children are added to the list of nodes.
  10. Then go through the list of nodes, and make the calls to `organizations.describe_organizational_unit` and `organizations.describe_account` and `organization.describe_organization` (for root) to get attributes like OU Name, Account Name, Account Status.
  11. Then add the children, OUs and the root as nodes and the parent child relationships as edges to a `networkx.DiGraph`
  12. Use the DFS algorithm on the above DiGraph to count children under each OU and add it to the OU's label for visulization.
  13. Write out the graph as a html page using the networkx module.

## __6. List of AWS APIs invoked__

```
organizations:ListRoots  
organizations:DescribeOrganization  
organizations:DescribeOrganizationalUnit  
organizations:DescribeAccount  
sts:GetCallerIdentity  
organizations:ListChildren  
```
